Compatable games list:
 * Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (Steam)
 * Sonic Adventure DX (2004 disc version, not Steam release)
 * Sonic Heroes

If there are no games to read inputs from, then your controller will be read from directly.

 * The background color can be defined in `BackgroundColor.ini`, (RGB values from 0-255)
 * The stick color can be defined in `StickColor.ini`, (RGB values from 0-255)
 * The program also counts how many times you have pressed each button. You can view the button counts be pressing the `B` key on the keyboard. Pressing `R` will reset the button counts to zero.
